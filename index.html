                                        <h3><a> </a></h3>
										<p><big>Welcome to Thumi, where we discuss the complex and interesting dance between Healthcare, Science, and Finance, all under the watchful eyes of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence—a symphony of innovation that holds the key to a brighter future.</big></p>
										<p><big>This hub is not limited to the 3 industries described above, it was merely as far my "creative" mind could take me, in coming up with an interesting opener (probably this is where the "dance" analogy ends).</big></h3>
										<p><big>There are plenty of brilliant ideas out there that only remain in the conversation of the research parties involved. This hub produces reflections on those ideas, as well as implementation or experimentation where needed. It also serves as a platform that documents our projects, especially ones that wear the hats of data science. It's a hand that reaches the domains of healthcare, science, finance, economics, technology, philosophy and even politics. You will discover how to move from discussions around vascularization implementations, and encephalization to chickens having human rights. The inspiration is to think outside the box, however, try to remain in the scope of practicality.</big></p>
										<p><em>Disclaimer: Any content prescribed in this hub should be viewed and consumed at your discretion. I do not intend educating anyone on any, but simply presenting a journey we could embark on, pursuing these ideas.</em></p>

										<p>In the realm of healthcare, the marriage of data science and AI has been so revolutionary. Imagine a world where predictive analytics warn of potential health risks, personalised treatment plans are created with the precision or the dexterity of a virtuoso, and medical research is advancing at a rate never seen before. We will explore how these technologies are changing patient care, diagnostics, and the very landscape of the healthcare community.</p>
                                        <p>We'll investigate the precision route made possible by data-driven healthcare solutions. Predictive modelling that anticipates health trends, the symphony of data and AI creates a beautiful song of care (we have not stopped using analogies). Join us as we uncover the transformative impact on patient outcomes, presenting a new era where healthcare is not just reactive but proactive. Relevent links to resources and experiments about these ideas are available.</p>

										<p>Our scientific adventure leads us to the frontiers of discovery, where artificial intelligence (AI) and data science act as our compass, pointing us in the direction of unknown territory. Expect talks about how algorithms are helping to solve complicated scientific problems, accelerating research processes, and providing new insights. The possibilities are endless, ranging from solving the massive universe's large systems to understanding the complexities of life at the molecular level.<p/><div style="height: 20px; background-color: white;"></div>

										<h1>Financial Intelligence</h1>
										<p>In finance, data science and AI are not just tools; they are key strategic partners. Investigate with us the algorithms that drive financial planning, investment strategies, and risk assessment. Observe how these technologies are opening up access to financial insights, assisting people in making wise decisions, and clearing the path for a financial environment that is more resilient and inclusive.</p>
										<p>Our journey into Financial Intelligence reveals the many interwoven strands of the economy. Explore the algorithms that are influencing risk management, managing investment portfolios, and forming the structure of financial planning in the future. We'll explain how data-driven insights are changing the traditional and conventional paradigm and offer a window into the dynamic interactions that occur between markets and technology.</p>

										<h1>What to Anticipate and A Glimpse into What Lies Ahead</h1>
										<p>Prepare for an array of interesting ideas as we set out on this exciting journey. Imagine this: The story of cancer could be rewritten by nanoparticles that are carefully navigating through the human body and carrying the promise of targeted chemotherapy to anchor cells <a href="https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.14293/P2199-8442.1.SOP-.PEGP0U.v1">(RoverMed BioSciences, 2023).</a></p>
										<p>Come to explore the complexities of AI-based segmentation in medical imaging, where 3D CTA images serve as a blank canvas for creativity. Watch the magic happen as the combination of patch segmentation and coarse segmentation approach presents a Dice score of 82.96%, bringing a fresh perspective to medical diagnosis and treatment regimens <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611123001052">(Xiaowei Xu, 2023).</a></p>
										<p>There is still more to our journey. Explore the center of the scientific universe, where the man-made sun, ITER, appears as a ray of hope for the search for infinite energy. a combination of technology and science that could change the way we think about energy. Visit: https://www.iter.org/</p>
										<p>Let us also present our tool that predicts coronary artery stenosis just before a myocardial infarction (heart attack) to avoid late or premature revascularization implementation <a href="https://github.com/Zwani/Myocardial_infarction_pred">(Myocardial_infarction_pred).</a></p>
										<p>In a world filled with endless possibilities, my team and I have embarked on a thrilling journey of growth. We've decided to challenge the norms, step out of our comfort zones, and immerse ourselves in diverse industries</p>
										<p>This hub is inspired by the diversity of industries. Still, as previously stated, we will confine ourselves to reflections. The labelled "blogs" tab provides analyses and insights into the concepts that will be covered. The GitHub profile is provided with some publicly available repositories of some of the works. The contact information is provided for any suggestions, criticism and feedback. My portfolio page as well as the teams' are included.</p>
										<p>Let's inspire each other to achieve greatness! Welcome to Thumi, where the extraordinary becomes the norm.</p>
